This is my code for creating a basic a form. The purpose of this code is to practice creating a basic form with required fields.  

Once the form has been complete with the required fields, the apply button will submit the form to request bin where you can view the input values. The request bin link is 'http://requestb.in/pdr5atpd?inspect'.
